## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog. I am really thrilled to start this blog. Hopefully, i will have the time & patience to update this blog occassionally.

Mostly, this space will be used to update my findings related front-end development (which is what i do), and some tips and updates related to blogging, seo and the digital space.

I think it would be a shame to me if i didn't thank [Chad](https://github.com/chadbaldwin) for helping this blog up on Github. If anyone want to start a blog for free, i would recommend setting it up on Github Pages. You can get more details [here](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

Thanks Chad for that detailed write-up, much appreciated ðŸ™Œ

So, that's it for now, i will be back with some new posts shortly.

Thanks for reading.
