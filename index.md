Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! My name is Saeed Salam, and I am a front-end developer from Kerala, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

I currently focus on React.js and Vue.js (specifically Remix/Next and Nuxt).

I will use this space mostly to update you on my work-related findings, as well as my personal opinions and reviews.

I occasionally make some trips, so you can expect some photos and write-ups related to travelling as well.
